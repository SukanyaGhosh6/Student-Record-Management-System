# Student Record Management System

While revisiting data structures and algorithms in Python, I realized that simply reading theory wasn't enough. I always enjoy turning concepts into something real and practical. So I thought, why not build a small project that combines lists, dictionaries, sorting, and searching all in one?

That's how this **Student Record Management System** came to life. It's a simple program that lets you add student records, view them, search for specific students, delete records, and even sort the students based on their marks.

It was the perfect hands-on way to strengthen my understanding of basic data structures and algorithms by solving a real-world problem.

## What This Project Does
- Add a student's name, roll number, and marks.
- View all students' records in a clean format.
- Search for a student by roll number using Linear Search.
- Delete a student record based on their roll number.
- Sort all student records by their marks using Bubble Sort.

## Concepts Practiced
- Using **lists** and **dictionaries** to store and manage data
- Applying **linear search** to find specific data
- Implementing a basic **bubble sort** to organize data
- Structuring code with **functions** for better readability
- Managing user interaction through **loops** and **conditionals**

## Why This Project?
As someone who believes learning becomes stronger through doing, I wanted to build something small but meaningful. This project helped me bring together multiple Python concepts into one place and see how they interact with each other. 

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the code in a file called `management_system.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder where your file is saved.
5. Run the command:  
   `python management_system.py`
6. Follow the on-screen menu to add, view, search, delete, or sort student records.
